  <p class="homestatement">What is COVID-19?</p>
<div class="homeparagraphphoto">

<div>
  <p class= "intro">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette.</p>

<p class="coronalight">Why we cannot take COVID-19 lightly</p>

<div>
<p class="coronalightdes">First and foremost, we cannot take COVID-19 lightly because of the effects that it already has over the entire nation of the United States. Across the United States we have had a confirmed 10,000,000+ cases, thats about a fifth of the global cases in total. We also are leading globally in deaths as well, having past 250,000 deaths. But yet across the country men, women, and children are annoyed and bored of having to quarantine. But if the United States had taken a much more serious approach at the beginning of this pandemic, then this website wouldn't have a need to exist. And all of our lives would be back to normal. But unfortunately, our government failed us, and we failed each other, because the mentality that most americans took on at the beginning was. "Other people may catch it, but I'm not other people." And this website hasn't been made to slander and demonize the american people, but to help them realize the mistakes, take responsibility, and move forward from it.</p>

<p class="whatcanwedo">What can we do to prevent the spread?</p>

<div class="whatcanwedocombo">

<div>
<p class="whatcanwedodes">COVID-19 is spreads mainly through respiratory droplets from when we exhale, cough, blow our nose, essentially anything having to do with our mouth and saliva. The virus can also stay alive on indoor and some outdoor surfaces for up to 2 days without any form of cleaning. Thats why we have to wear a mask, to prevent respiratory droplets, and we have to sanitize surfaces, to make sure that any of the virus that may have went unchecked is killed by the disinfectant. Within the two pages ahead of this one we shall go more into depth about masks, and in page marked "Spread", we'll be going over social distancing techniques that you can use to prevent exposure, and spread.</p>
