<p class="spread1des">As touched on earlier within the home page of the website, the spread of the coronavirus is what keeps it active, currently the infection rate of coronavirus on average in america is three to one. So if one person has coronavirus, and does not preform any type of quarantine, they will infect three people. To put that in perspective, seasonal influenza, or the "flu", has an average infection rate of one to one. So there is already a higher chance of it spreading, and flu like symptoms show after about 2 days (1 to 4 being the range). Meanwhile Coronavirus symptoms show up about 7 days (2 to 14 being the range), later due to an incubation period. Meaning that you can go a whole week of infecting others around you and have no clue, thats what makes this virus so effective at spreading. Refer to the graph on the right to see the effects of infection growth that occurred the UK in an exponential format.</p>

<p class="distancingdes">When taking in all of the factors that come into play when properly trying to disinfect, trying to make sure that you properly use a mask whenever you have to leave your house for necessities, such as your work or groceries, etc. Many people think of the whole pandemic as being something where you always must be prepared at all times. you have to worry about all of these different circumstances. But as long as you stay home, you're fine. Quite literally, as long we all stay home, we will dramatically curb the amount of cases. Through not exposing ourselves to the virus in the first place. It's truly that simple, because you need to be in person with people for the possibility. So as long as you minimize the amount you actually come into contact with people, not only are you protecting yourself, but everyone you care about around you as well.</p>
