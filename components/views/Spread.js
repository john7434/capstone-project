<p class="spread1des">As touched on earlier within the home page of the website, the spread of the coronavirus is what keeps it active, currently the infection rate of coronavirus on average in america is three to one. So if one person has coronavirus, and does not preform any type of quarantine, they will infect three people. To put that in perspective, seasonal influenza, or the "flu", has an average infection rate of one to one. So there is already a higher chance of it spreading, and flu like symptoms show after about 2 days (1 to 4 being the range). Meanwhile Coronavirus symptoms show up about 7 days (2 to 14 being the range), later due to an incubation period. Meaning that you can go a whole week of infecting others around you and have no clue, thats what makes this virus so effective at spreading. Refer to the graph on the right to see the effects of infection growth that occurred the UK in an exponential format.</p>
