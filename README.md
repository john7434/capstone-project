# Definition of audience
	
  My audience is any people who are currently uninformed of the dangers of the coronavirus, and may need to buy equipment to better help themselves.

# Definition statement
	
  I want to create a web application that will inform and educate people about the effects of coronavirus, the dangers of it, and the necessary safety precautions that they must take in their daily lives. And especially at their jobs if they cannot work from home.

# Elevator pitch
	
  Hello, my name is John O’Loughlin, I have worked in the fast food industry since the summer of 2018. My family has all decided that went want to take a coding path and joined Savvy Coders. All throughout my life, i’ve always heard of coding. From my mom first talking about it when she made a website for second life when I was 5, to my father Adam being an expert coder in multiple languages, I've been surrounded by knowledge, and people who are proficient at using it.  So when I first heard about Savvy Coders, I thought that maybe this is when I will finally learn coding, and use it to take the next step into adulthood, and learn some real skills.
My entire family has been quarantined to the best of their ability from covid, because of medical issues that would be made more severe from the virus. But whenever I check any social media or the news, I see people who are ignorant to social distancing and proper usage of safety equipment. So I wanted to make a website that would inform individuals.
To outline the entirety of the content available on my website, it will include: Explanation of what coronavirus is The dangers that coronavirus will present The proper distancing procedures to use in a workspace, and day to day life. Credible sources for the information provided, such as the CDC What kind of equipment is needed to prevent self exposure to coronavirus, such as masks, gloves, hand sanitizer, disinfectant spray, disinfectant wipes, etc.
